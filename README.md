# Introduction

This is my third project for Code Institute. I am really glad that I got to work on it because it gave me an opportunity to show my passions, which are gardening and storing information about plants - the flowers, shrubs, and other plants I alredy have in my own backyard and those I would like to have in the future. This is why I decided to create a plants database for small gardens.

# User Experience (UX)

This was probably the hardest part of my project. To make this project useful for visitors, I needed to create an ideal visitor's profile.

I assumed that this person would:

 - love gardening,
 - live in their own or rented house with a small garden or have a few plant pots on the balcony.
 - she/his is between 20-50 years old
 - she/his has little to intermediate experience in gardening
 - she/his wants to read a little about plants before they decide to buy them
 - she/his would like to take care of the plants in a natural way (without chemical fertilisers)

## First time Visitor's needs:

- they would like to know what the page is about, this means that the main topic is described clearly 
- easy and intuitive navigation throughout the webpage (divided into proper sections)
- to find plant descriptions, their needs, photos and some advice on how to take care of them
- know where to find important information for them (navigation bar and supporting descriptions on the page) 


## Returning visitors are very often interested in:

- reading more interesting descriptions of plants
- sharing saved descriptions and pictures with others users
- adding their own advice about taking care of the plants
- adding pictures and descriptions of plants they alredy have
- adding pictures and descriptions of plants they would like to have in the future
- sorting the plants by place (Sun/Shade etc.)
- editing saved plants
- adding pictures from own gardens to inspire others  

# Design

## Global 

## Color Scheme

The webpage has a white background and the pages and plants headings on the page have dark green color, so that they correspond nicely with the white background. All paragraphs are written in black to give a good contrast and give people a chance to read content easily. The navigation bar, footer and buttons on the page have the same dark green background to keep consistent design. White text is added to incerease the users experience. 


## Typography

## Imagery

Imagery is very important for this page, and is used throughout the website, so that it's visually appealing. It helps visitors remember flowers and easily identify them.
